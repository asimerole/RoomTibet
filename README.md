# My Practice Website

## About

This website is a **practice project** created to improve my web development skills.  
The **design and mockups** for this site were sourced from free resources available on the internet for learning purposes. I **do not claim ownership** of the visual design or assets used.

The **development and code** in this repository, however, are **entirely my own work**. Every line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was written by me as part of this project.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Only the **home page** of the site has been implemented, as no mockups were provided for the other pages. However, I am fully capable of creating **multi-page websites**. A live example of such work can be seen in my **portfolio website**: [My Portfolio Link](https://asimerole.github.io/portfolio/)

## Purpose

- To practice **responsive web design**  
- To implement **modern CSS techniques**  
- To improve **JavaScript functionality** and interactivity  
- To gain experience in **structuring projects for GitHub Pages**
